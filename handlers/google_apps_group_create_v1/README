=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Google Provisioning API library to create a 
new Google Group on your domain. If the input variables are verified
to be legal, then the new group will be created using that information.
If Google finds a duplicate group id during this process an exception
will be thrown because group id's are required to be unique. If the group
is successfully created, the specified owner will be assigned to the
group with admin privileges. Any errors that occur during the posting 
process will be caught and re-raised by this handler.

* Provisioning API must be enabled. To do so, you must:
  1. Log in to your admin account and select either the "Domain Settings" or 
     "Users and groups" tab, depending on what control panel version you have.
  2. Select the Settings tab.
  3. Select the checkbox to enable the Provisioning API.
  4. Save your changes.
