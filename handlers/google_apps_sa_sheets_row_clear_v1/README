== GoogleApps_SA_Sheets_Row_Clear
This handler clears a row on a given Spreadsheet in Google Sheets.

[Sheet Id]
  Id of the spreadsheet to clear values from.
[Worksheet Name]
  Name of the worksheet (inside the selected spreadsheet) to clear the row from.
[Row Number]
  The row number to clear.

=== Results
This handler returns no results.

==== Sample Configuration
Spreadsheet Id:        1xyao84fV2LyU1svyx48KTSbBgiq_mPr2w142bbZce8g
Worksheet Name:        Sheet 1
Row Number:            5

=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Google Sheets API ruby library to clear a row from a 
Google Sheets spreadsheet. Before using this handler, a valid Service Account 
must be created/used and the Google Sheets API needs to be enabled (see below 
for details on how to do this). Using the contents of a Google Service Account 
JSON key to authenticate against Google's API, the handler takes a spreadsheet 
id, worksheet name, and row number and removes the values from all the columns
in that row. (If you don't already have the spreadsheet id, it can be found in 
the URL when editing a spreadsheet in the browser - between the /d/ and /edit.)

ie. For the url - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xyao84fV2LyU1svyx48KTSbBgiq_mPr2w142bbZce8g/edit#gid=0
- the id is: 1xyao84fV2LyU1svyx48KTSbBgiq_mPr2w142bbZce8g


==== service_account_key_json Info Value
To authenticate with Google, the handler uses the contents to the Service Account
JSON key to authenticate against Google. When the handler has been uploaded to
Kinetic Task, open up the JSON key that was downloaded from Google (instructions
below if needed) and copy the contents of it into the service_account_key_json
info value (copy everything, including the beginning and ending JSON braces {}).

==== Creating a Service Account
  1. Navigate to the 'Google Developers Console'
    - Located at https://console.developers.google.com
    - If the URL has changed, try googling 'Google API Developer Console' to either
      find the console or find Google's current documentation for how to create
      an API project
  2. Create a new API Project
    - If you have an existing project, navigate to that project page if you
      aren't already there by default
  3. Navigate to Credentials
  4. Create a new Credential of the type 'Service Account'
    - When creating the Service Account, choose a 'Key type' of JSON
  5. Make note of where the JSON key was downloaded on creation. It will be
     needed for authentication later.

==== Enabling the Google Sheets API
  1. In the Google Developers Console, navigate to the Library section
  2. Find the Google Sheets API and click on the link
  3. Find 'Enable' at the top of the page and click it to enable the API

==== Allowing an Impersonated User to Authenticate with the Service Account
NOTE: To allow an impersonated user to authenticate with a service account, a
process called 'Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority' must be enacted by a Google
Apps account admin to allow a Service Account to impersonate users.
  1. Go to your Google Apps domainâ€™s Admin console.
  2. Go to the 'Security' page. 
  3. Select 'Advanced settings' from the list of options. If it isn't on the
     page originally, click 'Show More' at the bottom of the page.
  4. Select 'Manage API client access' in the Authentication section.
  5. Using the Client Id associated with your service account, attach 'One or
     More API scopes' for the services that you want the Service Account to have
     access to.
    - API Scope(s) needed for this handler: 
      - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
      OR
      - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets
    - If you don't have a Client Id associated with your Service Account (should
      see it under 'OAuth 2.0 client IDs' on the Credentials page), see the
      section below for setting that up
    - If they aren't explicity added in every time the scope list is updated, 
      any scopes that have been previously setup will be removed.
      - If you have a Client Id that already has domain wide calendar scope,
      to add the spreadsheets scope without losing the Calendar scope you need
      to add the Calendar scope to the comma separated list of scopes to add
