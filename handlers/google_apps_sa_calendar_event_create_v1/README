=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Google API library to create a new Event and then 
inserts it into your calendar. Using a Service Account Email and the
corresponding P12 file (see below for details about obtaining these values) to
authenticate the handler against Google's API. The parameters
are then slightly modified so that they work within Google's API and 
then the new event is posted to the calendar of your choice. Any errors 
that occur during the posting process will be caught and re-raised by 
this handler.
