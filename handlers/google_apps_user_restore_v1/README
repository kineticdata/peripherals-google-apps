=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Google Provisioning API library to restore a previously 
created Google Account on your domain. As long as the inputted username is
in the database it will be restored. If an account that is not suspended is 
inputted, this call will just pass through and the account in question will 
continue on as normal. Any errors that occur during the posting process will 
be caught and re-raised by this handler.

* Provisioning API must be enabled. To do so, you must:
	1. Log in to your admin account and select either the "Domain Settings" or 
	   "Users and groups" tab, depending on what control panel version you have.
	2. Select the Settings tab.
	3. Select the checkbox to enable the Provisioning API.
	4. Save your changes.
