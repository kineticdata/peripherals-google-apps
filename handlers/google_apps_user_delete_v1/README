=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Google Provisioning API library to delete a previously 
created Google Account on your domain. As long as the inputted username is
in the database, it will be deleted permanently. Use this handler with care,
because once an account has been deleted there is no way to get it back.
Any errors that occur during the posting process will be caught and re-raised 
by this handler.

* Provisioning API must be enabled. To do so, you must:
	1. Log in to your admin account and select either the "Domain Settings" or 
	   "Users and groups" tab, depending on what control panel version you have.
	2. Select the Settings tab.
	3. Select the checkbox to enable the Provisioning API.
	4. Save your changes.
