== GoogleApps_Calendar_Unshare
This handler unshares a Google Calendar.

=== Parameters
[Calendar Name]
  The name of the calendar that will be unshared.
[Unshare Location]
  The location that the calendar will be unshared from. If the calendar is
  currently public, the location is 'default'.  

=== Results
This handler returns no results.

==== Sample Configuration
Calendar Name:          Example Calendar   
Unshare Address:        test.user@acme.com

=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Google API library to unshare a Google Calendar that has
been previously shared. The handler first uses the inputted refresh token and
client id/secret to authorize the client (instructions on how to get these
values can be found below). A call is then made to exchange the Calendar Name
for a unique Calendar Id. Then another call will be made to Google to find the
ACL Id of the calendar (the rule that says who the calendar can be shared to) so
that it can then be deleted. Any errors that occur during the posting process will
be caught and re-raised by this handler.

* In order to use this handler, the account specified by the task info
values needs to enable Calendar API in admin account.

==== How to retrieve the Client Id, Client Secret, and Refresh Token
  To enable the Calendar API and get Client Id and Client Secret:
      1. Navigate to the 'Google Developers Console'
      2. Click on the Create Project button (or if you have an existing
         project that you wish to keep using, click on the project name.)
      3. Go to the APIs page and turn on the Calendar service
      4. Go to the Credientials page and Create a new Client Id
          * Select 'Installed Application' for the application type
          * Select 'Other' for the Installed Application Type

  To retrieve the Refresh Token for the account you want to post to
      1. Put this url into your browser, while substiuting [:client_id] for
         the client id of your application
      * https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=[:client_id]&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar&response_type=code&access_type=offline

      2. Choose or add the account that you wish to connect the handler with
      3. Click accept to give your application permission to modify the calendar
      4. Copy and paste the success code that appears on the page
      5. Send a post request to get the refresh token
          * This can either done with Curl or with a browser extension like
            Advanced REST Client in Chrome (A sample curl call is below)

            POST URL = https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token
            POST Parameters: code=[:code]&client_id=[:client_id]&client_secret=[:client_secret]&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&grant_type=authorization_code

            Sample Curl Call:
              curl -- data "code=[:code]&client_id=[:client_id]&client_secret=[:client_secret]&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&grant_type=authorization_code" https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token
