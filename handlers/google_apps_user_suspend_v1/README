=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Google Provisioning API library to suspend a previously 
created Google Account on your domain. As long as the inputted username is
in the database, it will be suspended. If an account is already suspended,
this call will just pass through and the account in question will continue
to be suspended. Any errors that occur during the posting process will be 
caught and re-raised by this handler.

* Provisioning API must be enabled. To do so, you must:
	1. Log in to your admin account and select either the "Domain Settings" or 
	   "Users and groups" tab, depending on what control panel version you have.
	2. Select the Settings tab.
	3. Select the checkbox to enable the Provisioning API.
	4. Save your changes.
