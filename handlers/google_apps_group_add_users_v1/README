=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Google Provisioning API library to add new members
to a previously created Google Group on your domain. A string of usernames
are taken from the input (external accounts need the domain included in their
username; iternal accounts do not) and then checked to see if they are valid
usernames (can only check internal accounts). If there are no invalid usernames,
the handler then adds these accounts to the group. Any errors that occur during
the posting process will be caught and re-raised by this handler.

* Provisioning API must be enabled. To do so, you must:
  1. Log in to your admin account and select either the "Domain Settings" or 
     "Users and groups" tab, depending on what control panel version you have.
  2. Select the Settings tab.
  3. Select the checkbox to enable the Provisioning API.
  4. Save your changes.
